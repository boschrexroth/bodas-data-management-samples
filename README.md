<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

This guide provides sample codes that you can reuse for pulling/pushing data from/to your BODAS Connect Data Management Instance. This guide will not show you how to implement your functionality. The examples are written in Python. Example written in other languages will be added soon.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Some topics are not covered by this programming guides and are prerequisites for being able to start using it. Moreover you have to setup your development infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

* Know-how on REST and REST-API methods
* Python3 Programming know-how if you want to use the Python3 sample code
* [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

## Sample Codes

* [iso15143ApiEndpoints](#) -- Pull machine and fleet data with [ISO Standard 15143-3](https://www.iso.org/standard/67556.html)
